# Parsing the delimited-text data

```{julia}
#| echo: false
#| output: false
repo = pwd() |> dirname |> dirname
``` 


The `readtranche` function lets you read an entire directory of ChatGPT's output. Here's how you can use it if you have a variable named `repo` pointing to a clone of the `LexiconMining` github repository.

```
#| warning: false
#| output: false
using LexiconMining
trancheroot = joinpath(repo, "suarez", "lewisshort-extracts", "extracts-cycle2")
dir = joinpath(trancheroot, "tranche11")
(data11,failed11) = LexiconMining.readtranche(dir)
```

The result comes in two parts: a data set composed of named tuples, and a list of files that did not parse properly. Let's look at a the first few entries in each list:

```
data11[1:5]
```

```
failed11[1:5]
```

What percentage of entries were parseable?

```
length(data11) / (length(data11) + length(failed11))
```

## Read a list of directories

```
#| warning: false
dirlist = [joinpath(trancheroot, "tranche$(i)") for i in 11:33]

resultpairs = map(d -> LexiconMining.readtranche(d), dirlist)
allgood = map(r -> r[1], resultpairs) |> Iterators.flatten |> collect
allbad = map(r -> r[2], resultpairs) |> Iterators.flatten |> collect

length(allgood) / (length(allgood) + length(allbad))
```
